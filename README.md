# Angular Recipe Book App
## Overview
I completed this project while going through the tutorials in Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's course [Angular - The Complete Guide (2023 Edition)](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/). I implemented features such as user authentication, fetching and storing data using a Firebase database, and using NgRx for state management. I expanded upon this project by creating Firebase database entries linked to each user account, allowing users to have their own recipes.
